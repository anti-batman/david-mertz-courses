    "A number of columns were probably created as CHAR or TEXT fields, but have only a small number of distinct values.  Those would be more efficiently and descriptively stored as enumerations.  You can create one within a particular database using code similar to (example from MySQL documentation):\n",

In each case, simply add a second text column called `description` (although more specific fields would clearly be needed for a production use).\n",
