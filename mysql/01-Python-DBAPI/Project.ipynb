    "In this respository, there is an SQLite database called `Airline-Tweets.sqlite`.  The lesson briefly mentioned `sqlite3` as a module in the standard library that will interact with single-file relational databases.  In particular, `sqlite3`, like `mysql.connector` generally follows the DB-API.  Although more specifics of the MySQL data definition language (DDL) are discussed in a later lesson, we assume you have a basic familiarity with the the SQL `CREATE TABLE` command for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario posed in this problem is that you have some data in a different database (SQLite), and you wish to transfer all contents to MySQL.  Moreover, you wish to do this *entirely* within Python and using the DB-API.  You will need to determine the structure and data types of the SQLite data, create an appropriate MySQL table, and transfer all rows into MySQL.  This particular SQLite data file contains only one table, named `Tweets` (about customer ratings of airlines).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a partial view of the kind of data we are transferring, this is a query performed within the `sqlite` command shell, which is generally similar to the `mysql` command shell that is discussed in later lessons.  However, you should perform all your work in Python for this project (the example does **not** list all the columns).\n",
