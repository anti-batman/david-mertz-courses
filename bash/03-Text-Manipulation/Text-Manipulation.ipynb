    "Unix-like systems have a broad range of tools for working with textual data.  A few of them are part of bash itself, but a much larger number are separate tools that are usually installed along with your operating system.  Many of these are part of the GNU Coreutils, specifically the tools that used to be distributed in the separate Textutils project.\n",

    "Whether or not your system provides you with these tools in their GNU versions, or for example as BSD equivalents or an combined tool like Busybox, nearly any system with `bash` will also have installed almost all of the tools discussed here.  Others can be installed as extra tools easily using a system-level package manager.\n",
