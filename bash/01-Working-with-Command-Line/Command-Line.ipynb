    "\n",
    "In parallel with bash being created, other derivatives of `sh` have also been created, enhancing features in somewhat different ways.  Some of these include KornShell (`ksh`), C shell (`csh` and later `tcsh`), Z shell (`zsh`), `fish`, and `xonsh` (an IPython successor).\n",

Most of this course will apply if you choose other shells, but for beginners, sticking with `bash` is the easiest approach."
