# Software Development with Python

Welcome new and returning students!

This course looks at tools in Python's standard library that 
aid in developing software written in Python.  In some sense, 
of course, ever module or library helps development, within its 
specific domain, but here we focus the actual activity of 
application development.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series 
of courses on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have a relatively
sophisticated knowledge of the Python language, and probably 
already be software developers.

Topics we cover include:

* The Python debugger
* Timing software components
* Tracing and profiling program execution
* Embedding interactive terminals
* Working with stack frames and tracebacks
* Inspecting the internals of Python objects

In the three hours of this course, you should get a good sense
of how to instrument and analyze your Python libraries and 
applications to reduce bugs and improve performance.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
