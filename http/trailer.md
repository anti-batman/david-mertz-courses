# Introduction to HTTP using Python

Welcome new and returning students!

The HTTP protocol is used by virtually every computer users hundreds of 
times a day.  This is true not only of software developers, but of everyone
who has a cell phone, web browser, or often just "smart devices" in the 
Internet of Things.

If you happen to be an actual software developer or data scientist, 
however, it becomes especially important to understand the underlying 
HTTP protocol, as well as security and network issues that relate to its use.

This course describes the HyperText Transport Protocol as a specification,
including understanding headers, status codes, and body content types.

Beyond the protocol itself, this course will teach you to use popular and
standard library Python tools to write both clients and servers of HTTP.

As a client tool, we focus on the third-party library called Requests.
As a server framework we look at powerful and flexible Flask library.

For this course, we anticipate students will have a an intermediate 
knowledge of the Python language, and already be data scientists or 
software developers.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
