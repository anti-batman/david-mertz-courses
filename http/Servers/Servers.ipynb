    "# HTTP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will somewhat parallel the prior one.  We look at the very simple server in the Python standard library, then move up to the widely use third-party library Flask. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nomenclature of Python web servers can be somewhat confusing.  Actual **servers** focus on the underlying sockets, i.e. servicing connections efficiently and in a scalable way.  However, the actual processing of HTTP headers and bodies, both in receiving requests and generating responses, is usually passed to an HTTP **framework**.  These different bits of code usually communicate over an interface called WSGI (Web Services Gateway Interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nomenclature is fuzzy, however.  \"Servers\" such as Gunicorn, Nginx, Tornado, Twisted, or indeed the well-established Apache, all themselves include the ability to serve basic pages with no framework, or in a sense include a basic framework.  \"Frameworks\" such as Flask, Django, web2py, or TurboGears (or *many others*) also include a basic development server in their package.\n",
    "\n",
    "At opposite ends of the spectrum of frameworks are Django and Flask.  The others fall somewhere in the middle. Django includes everything you can imagine, and many things you cannot, related to *web development*, from a MVC (model-view-controller) architecture, to its own database object-relational mapper (ORM), to an elaborate templating system, to an integrated administration interface, to an embedded framework of metaclasses, to many other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask, in contrast, does as little as possible, in as simple a way as possible.  If you wish to do those many other web development tasks, it does not get in the way of you using other tools for each task, but it does not prescribe particular choices, nor include them in the library itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week long bootcamp might scratch the surface on *some* of the corners of Django; an hour of video presentation in this course (perhaps with a couple more hours in the related course, *Secure RESTful APIs using Python*) will cover most of what Flask does."
