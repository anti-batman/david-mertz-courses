    "# Encrypted connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Security comes in layers. Before we can discuss authentication with JSON Web Tokens or HTTP Signatures, we need to talk about SSL security.  The goal of SSL, or actually of TLS which has superceded it to fix some weaknesses, is to have clients and servers communicate only encrypted messages.  This way, if anyone listens on the publicly routed TCP packets, all they see are random bytes that they cannot interpret.  When you use the HTTPS protocol, the \"S\" means that SSL encryption is used for the connection.  Ordinary web browsers usually add some sort of icon or coloring to indicate that secure URLs and connections are being used."

    "Imagine you wanted to make a request to this server.  Here it is on `localhost`, but it could equally be at a publicly accessible domain name.  In order to make this illustration simpler, the request will indicate the `identity` encoding so that compression of responses is not used.  However, keep in mind that compression is not encryption.  It can make text hard to read with the naked eye, but no harder for compression libraries, such as Python's `gzip` to expose the content."

    "The general topic of generating, signing, and managing TLS certificates (formerly SSL certificates) is outside the scope of this course, but is discussed in other INE courses.  This process involves obtaining (i.e. paying) a Certificate Authority to validate public and private keys.  In very brief overview, a system of public key cryptography with trusted \"root certificates\" is used in order to allow clients and servers to communicate in a way that does not use \"plaintext\" messages to each other.\n",

The lifetime of these keys is set to be short, and will probably be expired by the time you watch this.  You can generate your own as shown below.  The server needs to have both keys, but the public key, as the name suggests, can be widely distributed to anyone.  That's all the client needs for the encrypted communication."
