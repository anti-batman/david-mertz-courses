# Secure RESTful APIs using Python

Welcome new and returning students!

A software architectural style of encapsulating functionality as 
micro-services is increasingly popular and often has advantages over
traditional software library organization. Rather than creating a 
local function to perform a given task, you can create a small web 
server to perform that task, hence potentially allowing scaling 
based on how often users need to perform that action.

By using loosely coupled services that only communicate over defined 
web interfaces, it is easy to modify, upgrade, and test one 
micro-service without affecting others. Moving from functions to 
services requires very little refactoring within a lightweight web 
server, such as Python's Flask.

For this course, we anticipate students will have a an intermediate 
knowledge of the Python language, and already be data scientists or 
software developers.

Topics we cover include:

    * Stateless web services, called RESTful
    * Micro-service and cloud native architecture
    * MIME/media formats
    * Transport Layer Security, or TLS/SSL
    * Agent authentication
    * JSON web tokens
  
In the three hours of this course, you will learn to design secure
and RESTful web services to organize your code.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
