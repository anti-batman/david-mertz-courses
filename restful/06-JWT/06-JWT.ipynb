    "\n",
    "JSON Web Tokens, or 'JWT', are simply tokens that carry a richer context and more standardized encoded fields than the ad hoc random token shown in the last lesson.  The central concept in a JWT is a \"claim\" made between two communicating entities, where the features of a claim are simply JSON keys that take values in certain mandated forms.  The rules for JWTs are quite detailed, and are set out in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many protocols, what JWT specifies is not anything you could not do in your own way (as in the last lesson), but it provides some standard spellings for common features tokens represent.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “exp” (Expiration Time) Claim\n",
    "* “nbf” (Not Before Time) Claim\n",
    "* “iss” (Issuer) Claim\n",
    "* “aud” (Audience) Claim\n",
    "* “iat” (Issued At) Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these fields are optional.  Moreover, any other fields may also be optionally included, but do not carry prescribed meanings."
