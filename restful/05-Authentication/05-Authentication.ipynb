    "In the last lesson we looked at the need to make HTTP connections **private** in the sense that their content cannot be read by anyone other than the connecting parties.  It is also often desirable to control **permissions** to make certain requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simple case, there may be a limited number of entities (e.g. other microservices) that should be able to utilize a service.  In more stratified situations, services may respond differently based on the credentials of a requester.  Let's look first at the simpler case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple models we might follow for authentication.  One option is to require credentials upon every request.  Another, which will lead into packaged protocols like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is to use a token that encodes a previous authentication.  Cookies could be used to maintain such a cookie, or it could be included within requests along with other details."
