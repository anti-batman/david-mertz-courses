# Advanced Python: Iterators, Generators, Context Managers & Decorators

Welcome new and returning students!

Python provides a number of advanced constructs that can make the language 
more expressive, and in many cases more efficient.  Python expresses 
“laziness” via iterators, sometimes defined by generator functions, which 
are a way of describing delayed computation and infinite data streams. 
Context managers are a means of surrounding blocks of code with reusable 
setup and teardown.  Decorators allow you to express cross-cutting concerns 
for functions or classes that are given a general aspect, again with an 
emphasis on reusability.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series 
of courses on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have a relatively
sophisticated knowledge of the Python language, and probably 
already be software developers.

Topics we cover include:

* Understanding the iterator protocol
* Writing class-based versions of iterators  
* Using yield and yield from
* Combining lazy iterator streams with the itertools module
* An "algebra" of infinite iterators
* Using common existing context managers
* Creating context managers using decorated functions and yield
* Writing class-based versions of context managers
* Writing decorator functions and classes
* Writing parameterized decorators, also called decorator factories
  
In the four hours of this course, you will learn expressive, powerful,
and efficient ways to structure code, including how to refactor
and improve existing codebases.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
