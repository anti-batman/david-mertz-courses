    "A context manager, as the name suggests, provides a certain *context* to a series of operations in Python.  Whenever you use the `with` statement in Python, that introduces a context manager.  The idea in a context manager is that some initial setup is performed to prepare for your custom code.  A context object is often provided to your code that incorporates something about that context, and provides a name for you to utilize.  After the block of code nested under `with` complete, some cleanup actions can be performed.  For example, file handles and socket connections can be closed, or configuration settings can be restored to their defaults."

In fact, `.__enter__()` and `.__exit__()` are often simply synonyms for more conventionally named methods like `.open()` and `.close()`."
