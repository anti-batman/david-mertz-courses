    "Continuing the theme of the last two lesson exercises, we again work with a collection of 1000 files, each of which contain 20 integers, one per line.  As in the earlier exercise, the threaded style on these small files is unlikely to prove faster than a purely serial approach (but with larger files or slower reads, the balance could change).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should operate on all the data using 20 threads.  The calculation we make in this exercise is a bit different than prior ones.  Considering the data files in strictly alphabetical order, we want to perform a thousand operations; but this will be 4 basic operations, repeated on a cummulative result after each 5 numbers (i.e. 250 times for the exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence will be add, multiply, exponentiate, then modulo.  For example, for each file listed in the header\n",
    "\n",
    "| Line# | AA | BB | (+)    | CC | (\\*)   | DD  | (\\*\\*)      | EE | (%)    | FF  | (+)    | GG  | (\\*)\n",
    "|-------|----|----|--------|----|--------|-----|-------------|----|--------|-----|--------|-----|------\n",

    "Notice that since the first repetition of 4 binary operations takes 5 numbers, but each subsequent repetition works on that accumlated result, we do not wish to perform the final modulo operation for which we do not have a modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 20 threads should do this calculation for the 1000 numbers taken from corresponding lines of each file.  The results need to be stored in a global list whose order correctly corresponds to the line numbers of each calculation.  The trick, obviously, is that you do not want multiple threads to cause a race condition on that global list, and yet you also want the calculations to happen concurrently."
